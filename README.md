This is the project of automatic water can which facilitates daily planting routine.

## How it works

Whole system is composed of a mobile application, which user installs on their smartphone,
an IoT device enclosing microprocessor and a pump allowing the water to feed the flowers.

### Mobile application

A Flutter application designed to support watering device by adding controls and logic.
The user can create an account where they can store their plants, each one with different
placeholder. A camera installed on the smartphone can be used to identify user's flower.
Thanks to a plant identification and health assessment engine provided by [PlantId](https://plant.id/) API
we have managed to integrate machine learning to our application to help user take a better care of their flowers.
